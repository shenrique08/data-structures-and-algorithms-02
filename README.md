## 🧮 Key Implementations

### 1. Sorting Algorithms
- **Selection Sort**  
  (`1-sorting-algorithms/`)  
  - Time Complexity: O(n²)  
  - Space Complexity: O(1)  

### 2. Graph Theory
- **Graph Traversals**  
  (`2-graph/`)  
  - BFS/DFS implementations  
  - Pathfinding algorithms  

### 3. Binary Trees
- **Binary Tree Operations**  
  (`3-binaryTree/`)  
  - Insertion, deletion, traversal  
  - Final project: Advanced tree operations
